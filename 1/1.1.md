# Introduction
Open up a code editor [TODO: What is a code editor] and type

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<body>
		<p>Hello world.</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

You have just created your first HTML file.

What is this madness???

To start off with, tags the things that are surrounded by `<` and `>`. There are 3 kinds of tags: doctype, start tag, end tag.  
The *doctype* is the `<!DOCTYPE html>` that will always go at the beginning of your file.  
A *start tag* does not include a `/`. (Example: `<body>`)  
An *end tag* starts with a `</`. (Example: `</body>`)  
An *element* consists of a start tag, an end tag, and everything in between. The start tag of a given element always comes before the end tag of that element. (Example: `<p>Hello world.</p>`)

We'll get into more detail about the `<html>` and `<body>` elements later. For now, just know that they are requierd for a valid HTML file.

#### New Elements
`<p>`: a paragraph

## Nesting
This is valid HTML:

```html
<p><b>bold and <i>italics</i></b></p>
```

while this is not:

```html
<p><b>bold and <i>italics</b></i><b>
```

<small>Note: *valid HTML* refers to a valid section of an HTML file while a *valid HTML file* refers to a valid complete file.</small>

Why? The reason for this is that is the `<i>` element inside of the `<b>` element, or outside of the `<b>` element. In the first example, the `<i>` is inside of `<b>`. In the second example, the `<i>` is both inside and outside of the `<b>`, which is not allowed.

**The rule for nesting is that end tags must occur in the opposite order of their corresponding start tags.**

#### New Elements
`<b>`: **bold** section of text  
`<i>`: *italic* section of text  
`<u>`, `<ins>`: <ins>underlined</ins> section of text  
`<s>`, `<del>`: ~~strikethrough~~ section of text  
`<tt>`: `monospaced` text
`<br>`: Line breaks

## Attributes
Change your `<p>` attribute to look like this:

```html
<p align="center">Hello world!</p>
```

Your "Hello world!" should now be centered.

What happened was an *attribute* called `align` with a value of `center` was added. Attributes hold information about an element that the browser wouldn't otherwise know, for instance the alignment of a paragraph.

## Conclusion
We learned about elements, tags, and attributes.

When you're done, replicate the following lines:

No animal shall sleep in a bed <ins>with sheets</ins>.  
No animal shall drink alcohol <ins>to excess</ins>.  
No animal shall kill any other animal <ins>without cause</ins>.  
All animals are equal, <ins>*but* some animals are more equal than others</ins>.  
Four legs good, two legs ~~bad~~ <ins>better</ins>.
